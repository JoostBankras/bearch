# Report of process of the bearch app

### In short
The App I made in the last few weeks called Bearch is intended for people searching for a band or bands searching for a new member. In this App the user should be able to login and register, it also should have a filter function for the band and musicians. The bands and Members should all have an account and this account should be editable by the user self.
