# bearch

If you don't have loads of contacts in the music-world but have lots of talent playing an instrument, it can be very hard to get in contact with a band that suits your kind of music. Band members can be overwhelming so it is not easy to step up to someone and ask if you can play in their band. Besides it can be very maladroit to play in a band to have rehearsal 50 km's from home. Bands struggle with this too, it can be very hard to find a suited guitarist for example so the bearche app solves two problems.

The bearch app is meant for users who are in a band or who are looking for a band, it filters the users and bands by their city and region and makes it easy to look for people playing an instrument near to the place you love to and get in contact with them.
