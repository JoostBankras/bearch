My final product of this minor will be an app for musicians who are looking for a band to play with. The app will allow the people who are in need of a band to see which bands nearby are looking for musicians so they can contact each other.

## Problem Statement

If you don't have loads of contacts in the music-world but have lots of talent playing an instrument, it can be very hard to get in contact with a band that suits your kind of music. Band members can be overwhelming so it is not easy to step up to someone and ask if you can play in their band. Besides it can be very maladroit to play in a band to have rehearsal 50 km's from home. Bands struggle with this too, it can be very hard to find a suited guitarist for example so we solve two problems.

## Solution

- an app, this will connect all the bands with all the available musicians the app will contain a reaction option, if someone pushes that button it will send their account to the band who placed the request for musicians.
