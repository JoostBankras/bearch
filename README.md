My final product of this minor will be an app for musicians who are looking for a band to play with. The app will allow the people who are in need of a band to see which bands nearby are looking for musicians so they can contact each other.

__Problem Statement__

Nowadays it's not that easy to get in contact with a band which are looking for musicians. If you don't have lots of contacts but want to play in a band it can be very hard to find one that suits your kind of music
That's why this idea came up, an app that shows all the possible bands, including music-style and see all the band members
