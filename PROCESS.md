|3-6-2019 | Made an proposal in which I explained what kind of features my app will consist of and started with my design where I found out it are pretty much screens to make | No Standups today|
|4-6-2019 | Finished up my design with the classes and started up my project. Also did more research for the register and login API which I immedately put online on 000webhost.com | this app will make it easier for people to find a band near to their living place.  |
|5-6-2019| Struggled with the log in for the app and gained more information about the API. |Technical details : I have to make a database with two tables; users and bands. |
|6-6-2019| Finished Log in And registered with all the required information for the user| My to do list is to first start finish the log in and register function and to finish the skeleton of the app. |
|7-6-2019| Finished the prototype and got feedback on it. The prototype gave a clear view of what has to happen to fix the complete app| my standup colleague told that it was quite usefull and clear, the navigation could be better|
|11-6-2019| Most of today I struggled with the getting the log in and register function to work, I had some problems with the Internet connection of the phone (I think)| We had a discussion about the API's i should use because I have to store different information than most API's do. So I have to adjust some other API's to make my app working|
|12-6-2019| Started with adjusting the API I already found, made different SQL queries and found how to get the data from every user in the app | Not much to discuss |
|13-6-2019|Today I came with the idea that I wanted to sent request from bands to users to join there band. Spend the whole day on figuring out a way to make that happen but in the end it seems almost impossible with a mysql database. |together with my group we made a Styleguide.md|
|14-6-2019|Finished my alpha version, thought about how I should fix the joining a band system and found a better way, users are only allowed to make a request to join a band. Finshed a lot of API's on the server.|Showed the Alpha version with the standup team.|
