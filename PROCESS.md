|:-------------------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------| ------------ |
|3-6-2019 | Made an proposal in which I explained what kind of features my app will consist of and started with my design where I found out it are pretty much screens to make | No Standups today|
|4-6-2019 | Finished up my design with the classes and started up my project. Also did more research for the register and login API which I immedately put online on 000webhost.com | this app will make it easier for people to find a band near to their living place.  |
|5-6-2019| Struggled with the log in for the app and gained more information about the API. |Technical details : I have to make a database with two tables; users and bands. |
|6-6-2019| Finished Log in And registered with all the required information for the user| My to do list is to first start finish the log in and register function and to finish the skeleton of the app. |
|7-6-2019| Finished the prototype and got feedback on it. The prototype gave a clear view of what has to happen to fix the complete app| my standup colleague told that it was quite usefull and clear, the navigation could be better|
|11-6-2019| Most of today I struggled with the getting the log in and register function to work, I had some problems with the Internet connection of the phone (I think)| We had a discussion about the API's i should use because I have to store different information than most API's do. So I have to adjust some other API's to make my app working|
|12-6-2019| Started with adjusting the API I already found, made different SQL queries and found how to get the data from every user in the app | Not much to discuss |
|13-6-2019|Today I came with the idea that I wanted to sent request from bands to users to join there band. Spend the whole day on figuring out a way to make that happen but in the end it seems almost impossible with a mysql database. |together with my group we made a Styleguide.md|
|14-6-2019|Finished my alpha version, thought about how I should fix the joining a band system and found a better way, users are only allowed to make a request to join a band. Finshed a lot of API's on the server.|Showed the Alpha version with the standup team.|
|17-6-2019|Made it possible to accept some of the requests your band got, thought about what I have to do in this week left: show people their profile in the requests menu, remove people from your band, and make it possible for users and bands to have an Image, also have to fix that people can only apply for one band because otherwise it'll be a lot of work to store the other requests somewhere else.|the goal of this week is obvious : finish the app on Friday.|
|18-6-2019|Started with desiging some of the layouts and finished some of the API files, found out that my server on 000webhost.com became pretty slow so I have to find some other way of using the api files.|We will talk tomorrow about our repo because my app isn't complete enough and I will clear my repo after Friday.|
|19-6-2019|Struggled with the slowness of my server so I installed XAMPP and put all the API files in a localhost directory so I could access them fast. Also got a new hosting for my MySQL database so that is a lot faster too. Also started with editing the layouts, got a couple of pictures from unsplash.com and I tried to find a way to store pictures for every user, didn't found a suiting way so I have to continue with this tomorrow. If I finish that my app is complete and I can start finishing the layouts.||
