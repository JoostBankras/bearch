## Design for Breach

# manual:

starting at top left we see the homescreen of the app. This is where users can choose what they'll look for and to navigate to their profile page. 
- if the title of bands is tapped they will move to the filter for bands
- if the tile of musicans is tapped the filter for musicians will apear
At the filter the user is allowed to filter the results and if they continue they'll see the results of the filter. In the list of bands and musicians all items are clickable and if an item is clicked you'll see the complete offer. In the complete offer you'll get the opportunity to react on the offer and if that happens, all the members of the band will get a notification that someone wants to join their band ( if this is requested, else they won't get a push notification ). 

- There will be one kind of users but you'll be allowed to make a new band if you aren't in one. With that band you can make new offers for other musicans.
